					<span class="post-p-header"> Do you have any programming experience? This may be due to you prior education, your hobbies and interests, job or any other kind of experience. </span>

					<br>

					<!--All experience I got so far is the experience I made in school from 9th grade until my final year and also some coding I thought myself. I have been working with Java
					in school and have a ground basis but nothing special just the very basics and some MainFrame and DrawPanel knowledge. I thought myself some C++ basics from a book I got myself
					but then again also just the very basics. As a follow up I thought myself some HTML/CSS/Javascript and here again just the very basics. As you can probably tell I am not
					specialised in any specific language and it seems like more of a mess which it is to be honest. So this is basically my experience so far on programming in general. -->

					<span id="programming-yes"> Yes! </span>

					<span class="post-p-header"> You stated that you have some programming experience. Can you tell us where you had this experience? </span>

					<br>

					Prior Education, Hobbies/Interest

					<br>
					<br>

					<span class="post-p-header"> Motivate your programming experience. What kind of experience did you had? Which language(s) or platform(s)? Etc. </span>

					<br>
					<br>

					My coding experience started back in ninth grade where we started with Scratch. I really appreciated the programm and I always found my ways around to
					make my project work like the other but with less effort and other methods. Since the eleventh grade I started to have Java lessons. We started with the
					programm called Animozer and had our tests on paper so we would understand the topic better. Since the twelfth grade we have been working with Netbeans and
					started to work with Mainframe and DrawPanel. We learnt some algorythms and got teached the links between Objects and ArrayLists. Find and sort algorythmes
					were/are also part of the schedule. I also started to read about C++ and also got a book I have been reading for a week to understand the most powerful language
					know to human kind. I know the very basics and so far C++ and Java with Netbeans have been a lot of fun and yet challening because every time there is something new to learn.

					<span class="post-p-header"> Chances are that this questionnaire raises questions and/or doubts about your study choice. If so, we recommend to plan a personal study choice interview with one of the teachers. Do you want to plan such an interview? </span>

					<br>
					<br>

					No.
