					<span class="post-p-header"> Why did you choose this study programme? </span>

					<br>
					<br>

					I chose this program because of various different reasons. I got first in touch with IT when I was in the ninth grade
					where I happened to have to best teacher I had so far. He brought some fun and interesting facts to the subject. Long
					story short ever since then I started to investigate a lot of time into IT whether it was watching youtube videos about
					all kind if aspects of IT (mainly PC hardware) or just read plane articles. So when I found out about this study program
					at HZ I instantly applied because it fits in well with most of my interests. I can get into each and every topic of IT and
					therefor I took the oppertunity and applied for this study. The aspect of being close to the teacher and being able to work
					in groups helped a lot in the decision making process since I may not be the best coder but I would like to be a good one,
					one day eventually and being able to understand what I code and how everything is connected to another.

					<span class="post-p-header"> What initiatives did you take to make your study choice? </span>

					<br>
					<br>

					My girlfriend did most of the work on finding us an university which would have both programs we wanted/were looking for so I did not really do much besides
					applying and finding out what it was about.

					<br>

					<span class="post-p-header"> What do you want to do after graduating? What profession or position are you interested in? Why? What do you expect to learn during the study? </span>

					<br>
					<br>

					After graduating I would like to work in the game industry since it has always been a dream of mine to be part of a AAA game team.
					Yet by now I think that being able to develop software and being able to help different companies with their issues would be nice too.
					As you can see I do not really know where all of this will lead me to and yet I hope to be able to fulfill my dream one day.
					I expect to learn during the study how to develop games and software, how to work with other students and to understand different
					opinions on certain topics. Also learn how to work as a team and to work precisely is hopefully part of the study. At the end I hope
					that there will be a lot of different topics so I get the most information possible.
