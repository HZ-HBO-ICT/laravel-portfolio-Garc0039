					HackerOne is a collective of hackers working for good instead of bad. The bad people who use it against other people for malicious interests are so called 'Crackers' which is the
					complete opposit of hackers from HackerOne. Their hackers are described as skilled and experienced people making programs in an enthusiastic and fun way. So you do need a certain amount
					of skill and knowledge to understand their code and way to think. But by now you are probably wondering how they work and if you could also be part of them. As a matter of fact yes you
					can indeed work with and for them you just send them a mail or contact them via <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> HackerOne.com </a> and then you might
					enter the holy circle of HackerOne. As for what services they offer or what you could work for them as is clearly communicated:

				</p>

				<ol>

					<li/> Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)

					<li/> Bug Bounty Program (BBP)

					<li/> Hacker Powered Pentest (HPP)

				</ol>

				<p>

					VPD is their offered service about them solivng and looking for issues in your code. You can basically send them their code and they will try to find the issues of it.
					Bug Bounty is a very interesting and very good way for you to find issues and vulnerabilites of your website. This program is all about a group of hackers or even one only
					looking for bugs, not the animals but little loop holes you may have on your website. This is one of the best ways for the hackers to get paid since the price point per solved issue, depending
					on the difficulty of finding and fixing the loop hole, can reach from $100 up to $18.000.

				</p>

				<p>

					A HackerOne team or so called squad is composed of:

				</p>

				<ul>

					<li/> Project Lead

					<li/> Enigneer Manager

					<li/> Product Manager

					<li/> Project Designer

					<li/> Enigneers

				</ul>

				<p>

					Let's start with the Project Lead whose job it is to keep everyone up to date and on track on the pacing of the project. He/She has the responsability to talk with the engineers who code the whole
					program to keep them on the same pace of coding and keeping them up tp date about how their engineering colleagues are doing and also keep track of the whole project they are working on.

				</p>

				<p>

					Moving onto the role of the Engineer Manager who has the responsability to manage the engineers and whose job it is to communicate with the coding engineers to make sure that everything goes
					right and that everyone is coming along.

				</p>

				<p>

					Following with the Product Manager who makes sure that the project lead also coherences with the company lead. His/Hers job is to basically make sure that the project, a squad is currently working on,
					also corresponds to the ethical reasons of the company.

				</p>

				<p>

					As for the second last one, the Project Manager, his/her job is to communicate with the Project Lead and Projecta Manager and according to them and his/her own ideas create UI and UX Designs. UI meaning
					User Interface and UX meaning User Experience. All in all the Project Manager has to make sure that the user gets to have the best experience possible and to make sure that the website does not look like
					it was freshly thrown out of the window.

				</p>

				<p>

					Last but definetely not least there are the engineers who turn all the wishes of the rest of the squad into the actual website and who make sure that the website is safe. They also try to prevent to create
					loop holes for malicious purposes and in general do their best to create the

				</p>

				<p>

					Now you already know who gets which role in a squad but HackerOne also has a different approach in terms of how they apply their work into action. HackOne uses a method called Scrum
					Walkthrough, concept of - Concept -> Project Definition -> Taskifing -> Code -, which means that they give themselves a time window of 2 weeks and within these 2 weeks they have to go from having nothing to having created something useful by the end of the 2 weeks.
					Inbetween those 2 weeks is also a weekend so the engineers do not faint out of overwork. Also at the beginning they all talk together on what they will be working on and do not change the topic of
					it throughout the whole 2 weeks to make sure that they do not take longer than those 2 weeks and stay focused on what they should be working on. If someone comes up with another different idea they leave it
					for a future Scrum Walkthrough session. As for the ending of such a session they gather together and see how the team worked and if their beginning estimate of what they would manage to do was achieved or if
					they could have improved on something. FunFact: They use GitLab to test their code through each and every step, - Software Development Life Cycle, Task Management, Version Control, Code Review, Continous Integreation -,
					they got to make sure that their code runs smoothly and that it is safe to use.

				</p>

				<p>

					By now you already got a good overview of the HackerOne company but you are probably wondering what their core business is and that is actually called Tech Stack. It is composed by
					HackerOne Core, HackerOne Data Warehouse, HackerOne Payment and HackerOne Gateway. Let's start off with HackerOne which is all about what program they use including Ruby, Sidekiq,
					Graphqla Lib, Tailwind and Cucumber Live. Most of this Software is used for testing and preventing bugs.

				</p>

				<p>

					HackerOne Data Warehouse which is all about automating uploading and downloading of code. just like kind of a big Library of code. Moving on to HackerOne Payment which is all about their
					payment system for their hackers which is the main reason why hackers stick to HackerOne since they do pay very good. As for HackerOne Gateway it is all about the hackers being safe
					when working with clients and take over their computer. Some other crackers might want to take over and disrupt HackerOne for their own benefits. Therefor the hackers use HackerOne Gateway
					which basically is a VPN the hackers can connect too and stay safe when something happens since it gets very difficult to find the actual IP of the working hacker.
