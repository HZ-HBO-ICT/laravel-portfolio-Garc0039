						What and Who is HackerOne?

						<br>

						HackerOne is a collective of hackers working for good instead of bad. The bad people who use it against other people for malicious interests are so called 'Crackers' which is the
						complete opposit of hackers from HackerOne. Their hackers are described as skilled and experienced people making programs in an enthusiastic and fun way. So you do need a certain amount
						of skill and knowledge to understand their code and way to think. <a href="/blog/blog-post-company-safari"> read more </a>

						<br>
						<br>

						I chose this program because of various different reasons. I got first in touch with IT when I was in the ninth grade where
						I happened to have to best teacher I had so far. He brought some fun and interesting facts to the subject. Long story short
						ever since then I started to investigate a lot of time into IT whether it was watching youtube videos about all kind if aspects
						of IT (mainly PC hardware) or just read plane articles. <a href="/blog/blog-post-study-choice"> read more </a>
